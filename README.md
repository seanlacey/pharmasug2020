This readme will be fleshed out more down the line (especially after I complete writing my paper), but for now here's some basic information:

If you download this repository, this code should have everything in it to be able to run "ae_plot_from_template.sas" on your own machine.
The code itself will create "aeplot_template_test.html" which is a self contained file containing an interactive AE Swim Plot.

This is a proof of concept of the potential of templating D3 Data Visualizations for wider spread use within SAS.

Note: The data in sasdata is a dummy adae dataset in SAS format. It is wholey derived by myself using SAS and in no way shape or form contains actual clinical data.
